:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}
This is a co-taught Spring Semester module that teaches two cohorts of undergraduate students (2nd year BSc students & 3rd year BA students), and one cohort of MA students research methods in Psychology (the MA group have a different module code PS6112, and a separate VLE. This Case Study focuses on PS4033 only). It covers topics relating to research design, operationalisation of variables, validity and reliability of measures, and data analysis. For the undergraduates, it is the final research methods module before their final year and they begin their final year project.

The core texts for the module are: @field_discovering_2005, @howitt_introduction_2007a, @howitt_introduction_2007

![](resources/images/navigating/Slide11.png "texts"){height="400"}

The learning outcomes for this module are under revision. The published learning outcomes are not measurable, and are too general. The current learning outcomes and the proposed revised learning outcomes are displayed below:

|Current Learning Outcomes |Proposed Learning Outcomes |
|---|---|
|*Cognitive (Knowledge, Understanding, Application, Analysis, Evaluation, Synthesis)* <br> Knowledge of the academic discipline of psychology through in-depth interrogation of the concepts and principles of the variety of paradigms and epistemologies across psychological research. <br> Familiarity with the laboratory report and the requirements of scientific report writing.| *Cognitive (Knowledge, Understanding, Application, Analysis, Evaluation, Synthesis)* <br> By the end of this module students should be able to: <br> 1.	*Describe* core concepts relating to the academic discipline of psychology. <br> 2.	*Evaluate* the concepts and principles of a variety of paradigms and epistemologies across psychological research  <br> 3.	*Demonstrate* competence in research design, analysis, and laboratory report/scientific writing|
|  *Affective (Attitudes and Values)* <br> An appreciation of the role of ethical research in psychology and the development of knowledge more generally.  | *Affective (Attitudes and Values)* <br> By the end of this module students should <br> 4. *Display* an appreciation of the role of ethical research in psychology and the development of knowledge more generally |
|*Psychomotor (Physical Skills)* <br> Data coding and analysis in SPSS Ability to undertake advanced bivariate inferential statistics, assess psychometric properties of tests. Ability to formulate and conduct a research project. | *Psychomotor (Physical Skills)* <br> By the end of this module students should be able to: <br> 5.	*Demonstrate* competence in data coding and analysis using appropriate software (e.g., SPSS, R), undertaking advanced bivariate inferential statistics, assessing psychometric properties of tests, and formulating and conducting a research project|

<br>

The revised learning outcomes now all begin with an action verb, placing a stronger focus on the learner [@adam_introduction_2006] and a greater emphasis on how students will demonstrate their learning [in line with @donnelly_designing_2005; @adam_introduction_2006]. The revised learning outcomes do not make significant changes to the core competencies that were named in the originally proposed learning outcomes, i.e, the content covered in the module and the expected knowledge and skill acquisition remains largely unchanged, the revised outcomes allow for more measurable assessment of this knowledge and skills.




:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

The proposed learning outcomes span a range of levels of Bloomâ€™s taxonomy of learning objectives [@bloom_taxonomy_1956; @adam_introduction_2006], in both the cognitive and affective domains [@bloom_taxonomy_1956; @hadjianastasis_learning_2017-1], as well as the psychomotor domain [@university_of_limerick_writing_2008].

![](resources/images/blooms-taxonomy-verbs-feat.png.webp "Bloom's Taxonomy"){height="100%"}



## Design{#sec-design  .scrollable .smaller}

- The learning outcomes, the size of the class (>125 across all cohorts), and the overall structure of the module requires a strong blended approach. The delivery of the module is fully blended.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}


- In addition to these learning and delivery considerations, two key considerations underpinning the blended approach are:
  - The on-going COVID-19 pandemic. I continue to teach in a mask, some students may be high risk, and may prefer to avoid coming on campus or attending in-person lectures
  - The on-going accommodation crisis, some students may not be living near Limerick, and if they don't have to be on campus for class this may save them the time/stress of the commute.

:::

::::

- I deliver in-person lectures, and these are recorded and uploaded to Brightspace afterwards.
- The "attendance" requirement for the labs is now assessed using the *submission* of the lab worksheets (as opposed to physical attendance at the lab).
- The 24 hour exam format also facilitates the overall blended approach to the module

<br>
<font color=#005335>**Pre-Registration Activity**</font color>



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="15%"}


![credit [COS](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/badges)](resources/images/prereg.png){.lightbox}

:::

::: {.column width="85%"}


- A key major change introduced into the module this year is the introduction of a pre-registration activity.
- Students provide an overview of their planned research *before* carrying out the research. They receive feedback on this before they conduct the research, and complete the main report.


:::

::::

- The benefit of this activity is two fold:
  1. It reflects recent developments in methods in psychology; pre-registration is an increasingly adopted practice within psychological research, and it is increasingly becoming part of the publishing process. This activity gives students hands-on experience in working in-line with these developments.
  2. It provides an opportunity for a low-stakes piece of written work that students will receive feed-forward feedback, that can be integrated into their final report [@boud_Feedback_2013; @brinko_Practice_1993]
- This is also applies the principle of learning-oriented assessment [@carless_learningoriented_2007], in line with the view that "assessment, rather than teaching, shapes the experience of learning" [@mclean_this_2018; see also @ramsden_learning_1991; @bloxham_developing_2007].

## Implementation{#sec-implementation .scrollable .smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}

- In designing the Brightspace VLE, a key focus was simplicity and ease of navigation [@vanwig_Simplicity_2022]. 
- I created six separate parent tabs for each of *Module Overview*, *Lectures*, *Labs*, *At Home Labs*, *Assignment*, and *Exam* (right).
- This minimalist easy to navigate environment is accessible by clicking on the "Content" menu. This was flagged to students in the first lecture (below).

[![Click image for full-size](resources/images/slide_for_students.png "Slide For Students")](#slide-for-students-click-here-to-return)

:::

::: {.column width="65%"}


- Materials only became available as required, with the VLE becoming more populated week-on-week. This ensured that students weren't overwhelmed with content
- Within each tab the full materials for each topic are included - and organised by week where necessary (below).

:::


::::



:::: {.columns}



::: {.column width="65%"}

- After each lecture, the video recording of the lecture was embedded onto the landing page for that week (right). All recordings are made in Panopto with captioning enabled to maximise accessibility.
- The slides were uploaded the night before the lecture took place
- Any additional material (e.g., activities, key readings) were also uploaded within the tab for that particular week

- Each of the labs (left) and at-home labs included:
  - an instructional video, describing how to do the relevant procedure (with screen capture, and recorded in Panopto with captions enabled, maximising accessibility)
  - an activity sheet
  - a data file (or multiple data files)
  - a submission link

## Evaluation{#sec-evaluation .smaller .scrollable}

- The effectiveness of the blended learning approach can be examined using two indicators.
  1. Engagement data provided by Brightspace
  2. Students' responses to the Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET).
- Over the course of the semester attendance at the in-person lectures waned, with average attendance at less than 30 (out of 128 - 23%). This is not surprising, given the recorded lecture is available online.
- The online engagement with the recording and the other lecture material remained relatively stable at 60% or higher most weeks see @fig-lecture and @tbl-lecture for week on week stats.

- Similarly, the online engagement with the lab material is quite strong. At the time of collecting these data, the students still had two weeks before the deadline for submission of all the lab work.
  - For the "in person" labs, there was over 90% engagement for the first 4 weeks, with some decline for the remainder of the semester, but remaining at 70% or higher.
  - For the at home labs, the first 4 weeks show greater than 85% of the class engaging with the online materials, with some decline in the second half of the semester.

- The Student Evaluation of Teaching for this module also contains useful data for evaluating the blended approach adopted.
- On the Lecturer items, the item "*My teacher makes good use of Brightspace, or an alternative virtual learning environment and makes appropriate use of technology in his/her teaching*" scored 5/5 (see below)

- These indicators suggest that:
  (a) Students are engaging with the online components of the module, and
  (b) Students find the online components useful/effective/appropriate

## Reflection{#sec-reflection .scrollable .smaller}

- Overall, I am satisfied with the current blended approach for PS4033 Research Methods in Psychology. It is positive to see that students are engaging with the blended components, and the feedback from students is also very encouraging. 
- Despite the current set up working well, there are further changes I would like to implement in the future.
- One key change I made to the module this year was the introduction of the pre-registration part of the assignment. There is scope to build on this in conjunction with the introduction of more programming/code based statistical software packages (e.g., R or Python).
  - I do have a plan to introduce alternative statistical software packages in the future, though this will need to be done incrementally (to keep my workload manageable, and to avoid overwhelming the students - this year I re-recorded all the SPSS instruction videos).
  - By introducing code based statistical packages, students will be able to pre-register their analysis using the sample dataset, before gaining access to the main dataset.
- Another change I would like to make is to make better use of the discussion forums. These were useful for addressing students questions directly, however in future, I would like to see students interacting with each other on the discussion forums.
